A plugin to allow users to add custom CSS without having to either copy all existing code from the core events.css or add the correct @import to their custom CSS.


== Description ==

Automatically add /resources/events.css and /my-theme/events/events.css.

The Events Calendar CSS lives in /wp-content/plugins/the-events-calendar/resources/events.css<br>
User Added CSS lives in /wp-content/themes/my-theme/events/events.css

This plugin creates a wp_enqueue_style stylesheet that adds the correct @import lines for both the default CSS and the user CSS. This way the user only needs to add their overrides only to the events.css in their /wp-content/themes/my-theme/events directory.

== Installation ==

1. Create an `/events/events.css` file and directory inside your active theme or child theme directory.
1. `/events/events.css` only needs to contain the override CSS. No CSS code from the core events.css file needs to be duplicated.
1. Upload the entire `/the-events-calendar-user-css/` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin.
