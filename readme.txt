A plugin to correctly load users custom CSS overrides for The Events Calendar.


== Description ==
A plugin to allow users to add custom CSS without having to either copy all existing code from the core events.css or add the correct @import to their custom CSS.

Automatically load /my-theme/events/events.css if it exists using wp_enqueue_style.

User Added CSS lives in /wp-content/themes/my-theme/events/events.css for TEC 2.x.

The default TEC events.css will be loaded for you.

Correctly load tribe-events.css in proper order when using both TEC 3.x and TECPro 3.x.

== Installation ==

1. Create an `/events/events.css` file and directory inside your active theme or child theme directory.
1. `/events/events.css` only needs to contain the override CSS. No CSS code from the core events.css file needs to be duplicated.
1. Upload the entire `/the-events-calendar-user-css/` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin require The Events Calendar plugin? =

Yes. [The Events Calendar plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/the-events-calendar/) is written by Modern Tribe, Inc. It requires at least The Events Calendar v2.0.5.

= What do I name the override folder? =

* For The Events Calendar 2.x name the override folder `'events'`

= Do I really need this? =

No, if you're using The Events Calendar 3.x all you need to do is create the following structure in your theme's folder. `{YOUR_THEME}/tribe-events/tribe-events.css`. This file should contain only the override CSS. It will be loaded automatically by TEC 3.0. If you're trying to override CSS in The Events Calendar PRO 3.x then you will need this as the CSS for TECP is loaded after the automatic loading of tribe-events.css.

= Where can I report bugs? =

Add a new topic on the [WordPress Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/the-events-calendar-user-css).
